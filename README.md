## High level design

### Application architecture
### Simple data interaction flow
## Features
### Angular application and simple Nest API
- [x] Easy to understand project structure
- [x] Simple CRUD list and its tasks
- [x] Search/filter tasks

While working with this application, I have the opportunity to revisit some of the interesting topics:
- Deploy Angular application to Netlify

## Setting up development environment
- `git clone https://github.com/Hanh2212/angular-task-management.git`
- `cd angular-task-management/frontend`
- `npm start` for angular web application
- The app should run on `http://localhost:4200`
